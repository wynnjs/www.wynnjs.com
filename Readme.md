To install the project you need Grunt. And Bower. And Yeoman. And a unix system
(must be ubuntu, but we wont specify that). And nodejs v12.2. And some C
libraries that I assume you have on your system. 

Building the library is a standard grunt build, which i'll condescendingly
decide you know how to do because you are a hipster as well right? Once you've
built the project, you'll get a single javascript file - which isnt hosted
anywhere because you shouldnt use this project if you dont understand it.
